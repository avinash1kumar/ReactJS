# two way binding

```
input me kuch likhte hai tow waha per ek event chalta hai jo hai onChange={}
```
* value tell the current value of 'input'
when you pass title inside value{} then whatever you write it can't visible on input. becauese u are passing the value of title of useState

** in onChange{} we use setTitle() . so that whenever user write any thing it get directly visible in input
